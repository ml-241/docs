## Contribution Guide

Thanks for contributing to Fern's documentation!

### Writing tips

Keep the following principles in mind:

- **Write for your audience** - Consider why users are reading your documentation and explain the use case clearly. Focus on clarity and completeness without being verbose. Add examples and code snippets when relevant.
- **Help users get something done**. Don't try to sell users on the product, and avoid marketing language like "amazing features" or "the best solution."
- **Write in clear, concise language**, using [active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice) whenever possible. Keep sentences and paragraphs short and to the point. Use a friendly, casual tone and stay away from jargon as much as you can.
- **Use [Fernâ€™s documentation components](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/writing-content/components/overview)** whenever you can.
- **When editing an existing page** - Match the existing heading structure, tone, and level of detail to ensure your changes integrate as seamlessly as possible.

**For language and grammar help**, check out [Google's developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) or Microsoft's [writing style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

### Getting changes reviewed

If you want to **add a new page or make a large structural change**:
- [File an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/fern-api/docs/issues) and assign @devalog and @kgowru. We'll review your issue to make sure your proposed page fits with Fern's overall documentation strategy and isn't duplicating any ongoing work. 

For **all other changes**:
-  Submit a PR directly with your suggested changes. A Fern docs member will review and confirm.

If you see something that is wrong or outdated in the documentation but don't know how to fix it, [file an issue](https://github.com/fern-api/docs/issues) or reach out to @devalog and @kgowru.
