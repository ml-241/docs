## Add Posthog to your Docs

To integrate PostHog, you'll need a Posthog API Key, and optionally, you can configure a custom Posthog host.

### Integrate Posthog

You can find your PostHog API Key under your [project settings.](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project)

Then, in your `docs.yml` file, add your Posthog configuration:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  posthog:
    api-key: ${POSTHOG_API_KEY} # reads your api key from environment variables
    # Optional
    endpoint: ${POSTHOG_API_HOST} # e.g. https://analytics.example.com or https://eu.i.posthog.com
```
</CodeBlock>
