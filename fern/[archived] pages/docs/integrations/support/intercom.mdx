## Add Intercom to your Docs

To add Intercom to your Docs, you need to your Intercom `app_id`, also known as the Intercom workspace ID.
This is a unique code assigned to your app when you create it in Intercom.

Additionally, you may configure a custom Intercom endpoint.

### Get your Intercom App Id

Your app ID is available under [Settings > Workspace > General](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/_/settings/workspace/general)
in the "Workspace name & time zone" tab.

See [Intercom's FAQ](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8771110-getting-started-faqs#h_c12f89cf9d) for visual instructions.

### Integrate Intercom with your Docs

In your `docs.yml` file, add your Intercom config:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
analytics:
  intercom:
    app-id: ${INTERCOM_APP_ID} # reads your org id from environment variables
    # Optional
    endpoint: ${INTERCOM_ENDPOINT} # e.g. https://intercom.custom-instance.com
```
</CodeBlock>
