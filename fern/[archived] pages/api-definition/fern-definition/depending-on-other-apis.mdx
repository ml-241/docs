subtitle: Import API Definitions to generate unified SDKs

Fern allows you to import other APIs into your API.

This is often useful if:

- you want to reuse another API's types in your API
- you want to combine multiple microservices' APIs into one SDK (similar to the AWS SDK)

## Registering the dependency API

The first step is to **register** the API you want to depend on. To do this, use
the `register` command:

```
$ fern register
[some-dependency]: Uploading definition...
[some-dependency]: Registered @fern/some-dependency:0.0.1
```

## Depending on the registered API

To add a dependency on another API, you must add a `dependencies.yml` to declare which 
APIs you wish to depend on. 

```bash {4}
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ generators.yml
├─ dependencies.yml
└─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml
  ├─ imdb.yml
```

Your `dependencies.yml` has a list of all the APIs you wish to depend: 

```yaml dependencies.yml 
dependencies:
   "@fern/some-dependency": "0.0.1"
```

Next, you need create a folder in your Fern Definition to house the dependency. Inside the folder, create a special file
`__package__.yml` which specifies the dependency and version you want to add.

```bash {8-9}
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ generators.yml
├─ dependencies.yml
└─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml
  ├─ imdb.yml
  └─ my-folder
    └─ __package__.yml  
```

```yaml __package__.yml
export:
  dependency: "@fern/some-dependency"
```

When you generate the SDK with `fern generate`, the `__package__.yml` file will
effectively be replaced with the API you're depending on.
