## Add Fullstory to your Docs

To add Fullstory to your Docs, you need to add your Fullstory `orgId` to your `docs.yml` file.

### Get your Fullstory Org ID

When you login to your Fullstory account, your Org ID can be found in the URL of your browser.

```
https://app.fullstory.com/ui/<ORG_ID>/home
```

Additionally, you can find your Org ID in [Settings > Data Capture and Privacy > Fullstory Setup](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047075853-How-do-I-find-my-Fullstory-Org-Id#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20your%20Org,embedded%20in%20the%20Fullstory%20snippet.&text=More%20information%20about%20installation%20and,the%20URL%20of%20your%20browser.)
inside the Fullstory snippet:

1. Log in to your Fullstory account.
2. Find **Settings** in a dropdown by clicking your organization's name or logo in the top left.
3. Navigate the sidebar to the Data Capture and Privacy section. Click on "Fullstory Setup", located under the heading.
4. Retrieve the Org Id from the snippet, where it is assigned to `window['_fs_org']`. It will appear as `window['_fs_org'] = '<ORG_ID>'`.

You can find visual instructions in [Fullstory's guide](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047075853-How-do-I-find-my-Fullstory-Org-Id#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20your%20Org,embedded%20in%20the%20Fullstory%20snippet.&text=More%20information%20about%20installation%20and,the%20URL%20of%20your%20browser.)

```
</CodeBlock>
