## Dependency Free

Fern generates TypeScript SDKs with zero external dependencies, delivering clean output that minimizes bundle size, avoids version conflicts, and drastically reduces security risk.

The dependency-free design is part of Fern's broader commitment to generating idiomatic, zero-dependency TypeScript SDKs from OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, gRPC, and other common specifications, ensuring that you can integrate Fern-generated SDKs into any project without introducing additional complexity or maintenance overhead.

### Key Benefits

**Security** â€“ By eliminating external dependencies, there are no third-party packages that could introduce vulnerabilities or become unmaintained over time. This removes supply chain attack vectors and the need to constantly monitor transitive dependencies for security patches.

**Performance** - Zero dependencies result in smaller bundle sizes, leading to faster load times and better performance across all deployment targets - particularly important for browser applications, edge computing environments, and mobile applications.

**Compatibility** - Zero dependencies prevent conflicts, especially in monorepos or apps with overlapping libraries. This eliminates version conflicts when different parts of an application require different versions of the same dependency, making integration seamless regardless of the existing dependency graph.

## Isomorphic

Fern-generated TypeScript SDKs work seamlessly across all JavaScript environments without requiring modifications, polyfills, or environment-specific code. Key features:

- **Platform-native APIs** - Uses `ReadableStream`, `FormData`, and Fetch API in browsers/Deno; `Readable` and `fs.ReadStream` in Node.js for optimal performance without adapters
- **Module format support** - Includes both ESM and CommonJS outputs for compatibility across different module systems and bundling tools

### Supported Environments

| Server-Side | Client-Side |
|-------------|-------------|
| Node.js (including older LTS versions) | Modern browsers |
| Deno, Bun | React Native |
| Edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions) | WebWorkers and ServiceWorkers |

## Strongly Typed

Fern generated SDKs are optimized for great autocompletion in 
code editors. Developers will receive compile errors when they forget to 
specify required fields or attempt to access fields that do not exist. 

  TypeScript SDKs are published with type declarations (i.e. `.d.ts` files). This
  ensures that TypeScript consumers can leverage compile-time safety and 
  intellisense when using the SDK. 
  
  Each SDK method is annotated with request and response types.  

  ```typescript maxLines=0 {10}
  import { Genre } from "../genre";

  export interface MovieClient {

    /**
     * Creates a movie
     * @param request the movie to create
     * @returns the created Movie
     */
    create(request: CreateMovieRequest): Promise<Movie>; 
  }

  export interface CreateMovieRequest {
    name: string;
    genre: Genre; 
  }

  export interface Movie {
    /* Generated ID for the movie */
    id: string;
    name: string;
    genre: Genre; 
  }
  ```

## Auto-pagination

Instead of forcing SDK users to learn the intricacies of your pagination system, Fern SDKs will return an iterator so that users can simply loop through all the results.

  When pagination for an endpoint is configured, the TypeScript SDK method 
  will return a `Page<T>` where `T` is the underlying data type. The `Page<T>`
  will implement the `AsyncIterable` interface, allowing you to use it in a
  `for await` loop.

  Below is an example method signature for a list endpoint: 
  ```typescript UsersClient.ts {10-13}
  import core from "../core";

  export interface UsersClient {

    /**
     * List all users
     * @param props 
     * @returns A page of users
     */
    list(
      request: ListUsersRequest = {}, 
      requestOptions: core.RequestOptions = {}
    ): core.Page<User>;
  }
  ```

  And here is an example of how a user would use the `list` method:
  ```typescript
  const response = await client.users.list();
  for await (const user of response) {
    console.log(user);
  }
  ```
  

### Supported pagination types

Fern supports the following pagination schemes:

| Pagination Scheme | Supported                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Offset-based      | <Icon icon="check" color="var(--accent-a11)" />            |
| Cursor-based      | <Icon icon="check" color="var(--accent-a11)" />            |
| Link-based        |                                                  |

#### Configuration

Annotate the desired paginated endpoint with the `x-fern-pagination` extension.
For these fields, you can simply specify the dot-access path to the related request or response property.

For example, should the results of the following object be found in the subfield `inner_list`, you would specify `results: $response.my_nested_object.inner_list`.

```yaml
MyResponseObject:
  type: object
  properties:
    my_nested_object:
      type: object
      properties:
        inner_list:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/MyObject'
```

<Tab title="OpenAPI">
<CodeBlocks>

...
paths:
  /path/to/my/endpoint:

...
```

```yaml Cursor
...
paths:
  /path/to/my/endpoint:
    get:
      x-fern-pagination:
        cursor: $request.cursor
        next_cursor: $response.next
        results: $response.results
...
```

        results: $response.data
```

## Forward Compatibility


Fern SDKs are designed so that you can evolve your API without breaking users on 
legacy SDKs. You can safely add additional response properties, enum values, and union variants. 
The legacy SDKs will safely handle deserializing extra information. 

  ### Additional Response Properties
  As you make new response properties available, 
  the legacy SDKs will continue to work. For example, let's say you 
  generated an SDK that had the following `Movie` object: 
  ```ts
  export interface Movie {
    name: string;
    id: string;
  }
  ```

  If you decided to add a new `genre` property on your server, the SDK will 
  simply pass the extra property back. Users would also be able to access
  the property by doing

  ```ts
  const genre = movie['genre'];
  ```

  ### Additional Enum values
  As you add additional enum properties on your server, the 
  legacy SDKs will continue to work. For example, let's say your generated SDK 
  had the following `Genre` type: 

  ```ts
  export type Genre =
    | "horror"
    | "action"
    | "thriller"
    | "drama";
  ```

  If you decided to add a new enum value `comedy`, the SDK will simply pass 
  the string value back to the user. The consumer can then handle this case
  in the default case of a switch statement.

  ```ts {6-7}
  switch(genre) {
    case "horror": 
    case "action": 
    case "thriller": 
    case "drama": 
    default: 
      console.log(genre); // prints out comedy
  }
  ```

  ### Additional union variants
  Similar to additional enum properties, if you add additional union types 
  on your server, the legacy SDKs will continue to work. For example, let's say your 
  generated SDK had the following `Shape` type: 

  ```ts
  export type Shape = Square | Circle;

  export interface Circle {
    type: "circle",
    radius: number
  }

  export interface Square {
    type: "square",
    side: number
  }
  ```

  If you decided to add an additional union type called `Triangle` 

  ```ts
  + export type Shape = Square | Circle | Triangle;

  + export interface Triangle {
  +   type: "triangle",
  +   a: number
  +   b: number
  +   c: number
  + }
  ```
  
  then the user could simply handle the unknown case in their legacy SDK. 
  ```ts {6-7}
  switch (type) {
    case "circle": 
      ...
    case "square": 
      ...
    default: 
      console.log(type); // prints out triangle
  }
  ```

## Full Spec Support

Fern's TypeScript SDK generator provides comprehensive support across several
API specification formats, ensuring broad compatibility with existing API
ecosystems and tooling. 

Once you have an API definition, Fern will use it as an input to generate artifacts 
like SDKs and API Reference documentation. Every time you update the API definition,
you can regenerate these artifacts and ensure they are always up-to-date.

Fern integrates with the following API definition formats:

    The Fern Definition is our take on a simpler API definition format. It is designed with **best-practices**, 
    supports **both RESTful and event-driven APIs**, and is optimized for **SDK generation**. 

    <Note>
      The Fern Definition is inspired from internal API Definition formats built at companies like 
      [Amazon](https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html), [Google](https://grpc.io/), [Palantir](https://blog.palantir.com/introducing-conjure-palantirs-toolchain-for-http-json-apis-2175ec172d32),
