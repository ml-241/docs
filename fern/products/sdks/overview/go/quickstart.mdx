### Add the SDK generator

Add the Go SDK generator:

```bash
fern add fern-go-sdk --group sdk
```

This command adds the following to `generators.yml`:

```yaml
  sdk:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: <Markdown src="/snippets/version-number.mdx"/>
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../sdks/go
```

<Markdown src="/products/sdks/snippets/generate-sdk.mdx"/>

```bash
fern/ # created by fern init
sdks/ # created by fern generate --group sdk
├─ go
    ├─ core/
    └─ resources/
```
