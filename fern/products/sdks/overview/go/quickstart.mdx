<Steps>

<Markdown src="/products/sdks/snippets/pass-fern-check.mdx"/>

### Add the SDK generator

Add the Go SDK generator:

```bash
fern add fern-go-sdk --group go-sdk
```
<Note>
  `go-sdk` is the name of the `generators.yml` group that configures your Go
  SDK's output location and other metadata. You can customize this group name to
  differentiate between multiple SDKs across different languages (e.g.,
   `ruby-sdk`, etc) in your organization.
</Note>

This command adds the following to `generators.yml`:

```yaml
  go-sdk:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: <Markdown src="/snippets/version-number.mdx"/>
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../sdks/go
```

### Generate the SDK

  Generate the SDK:

  ```bash
  fern generate --group go-sdk
  ```

  <Markdown src="/products/sdks/snippets/generate-sdk.mdx"/>

```bash
fern/ # created by fern init
sdks/ # created by fern generate --group go-sdk
├─ go
    ├─ core/
    └─ go.mod
```
