title: Configure Global Headers
description: Guide to configuring global headers in your SDKs.
---

Your API may leverage certain headers for every endpoint or most endpoints.
These are called **global headers**.

## How it works for SDK users

Once you configure a global header (either automatically detected or manually
specified), Fern generates an SDK that accepts this as a constructor parameter.
Users can then provide the value once, and the generated SDK automatically
includes the header in all their API calls:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str):
```

## Specifying global headers

Fern automatically identifies headers that are used in every request, or the
majority of requests, and marks them as global. You can manually configure additional
global headers in either `api.yml` (Fern Definition) or `openapi.yml`.

<Accordion title="Fern Definition">

To specify headers that are meant to be included on every request:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml {3}
name: api
headers:
  X-App-Id: string
```
</CodeBlock>

### Global path parameters
You can also specify path parameters that are meant to be included on every request:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
base-path: /{userId}/{orgId}
path-parameters:
  userId: string
  orgId: string
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Overriding the base path

If you have certain endpoints that do not live at the configured `base-path`, you can 
override the `base-path` at the endpoint level. 

```yml imdb.yml {5}
service: 
  endpoints: 
    getMovie: 
      method: POST
      base-path: "override/{arg}"
      path: "movies/{movieId}"
      path-parameters: 
        arg: string
```

<Note>
  You cannot yet specify query parameters that are meant to be included on every request.

<Accordion title="OpenAPI">

Use the `x-fern-global-headers` extension to label additional headers as global
or to alias the names of global headers:

```yaml title="openapi.yml"
x-fern-global-headers:
  - header: custom_api_key
    name: api_key
  - header: userpool_id
    optional: true
```

This configuration yields the following client:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str, userpoolId: typing.Optional[str])
```
