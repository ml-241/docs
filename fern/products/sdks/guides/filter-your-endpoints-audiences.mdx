title: Filter Your Endpoints (Audiences)
description: Guide to filtering your API endpoints using audiences.

<Markdown src="/snippets/pro-callout.mdx"/>

Use audiences to generate tailored SDKs for different groups of API consumers. Common examples of audiences include:
- Internal consumers (e.g., frontend developers who use the API)
- Beta testers
- Customers

Learn how to use audiences to filter which endpoints are included in your SDKs and documentation.


## Configuring audiences

For both the Fern Definition and OpenAPI spec, configuring audiences involves:
1. Marking your API elements with audience tags.
1. Applying filters in `generators.yml`. Without filtering configuration, all endpoints will
be included in your SDK regardless of their audience tags. 


<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Fern Definition">

Configuring audiences in a Fern Definition involves:

1. Explicitly defining audiences in `api.yml`.
1. Configuring audiences for specific endpoints, types, and properties.
1. Apply audience filters to your SDK so only certain endpoints are passed to the generators.

<Steps>
### Defining audiences

Audiences are explicitly declared in Fern Definition.
To use audiences in your Fern Definition, add them to `api.yml`. 

In the example below, we have created audiences for `internal`, `beta`, and `customer` groups:

```yaml title='api.yml' {2-5}
name: api 
audiences: 
  - internal 
  - beta 
  - customers
```
### Apply audiences to your endpoints, types, and properties

Once you've defined audiences, mark endpoints, types, or properties for a
particular consumer by adding an `audience` with the relevant groups. 

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Endpoints">

In this example, the `sendEmail` endpoint is only available to internal consumers:

```yaml title='user.yml' {6-7}
service:
  base-path: /users
  auth: true
  endpoints:
    sendEmail:
      audiences:
        - internal
      path: /send-email
      ...
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Types">

Types can also be marked for different audiences. 

In this example, the `Email` type is available to internal and beta consumers:

```yaml title='user.yml' {5-7}
Email: 
  properties:
    subject: string
    body: optional<string>
  audiences: 
    - internal
    - beta
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Properties">
In this example, the `to` property is available to beta consumers only:

```yaml title='user.yml' {8-9}
Email: 
  properties:
    subject: string
    body: optional<string>
    to: 
      type: string
      docs: The recipient of the email
      audiences: 
        - beta
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Set up SDK filters in `generators.yml`

In `generators.yml`, you can apply audience filters so that only certain
endpoints are passed to the generators. 

The following example configures the SDKs to filter for `customers`:

```yaml title='generators.yml' {3-4}
groups:
  external:
    audiences:
      - customers
    generators: 
    ...
```
### Generate your SDK

  ```bash
  fern generate --group sdk
  ```
</Steps>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="OpenAPI">

Configuring audiences in an OpenAPI spec involves:

1. Configuring audience extensions for specific servers, endpoints, schemas, and properties.
1. Apply audience filters to your SDK so only certain endpoints are passed to the generators.

<Note>
    Unlike the Fern Definition, OpenAPI doesn't have a central audience declaration. 
</Note>

<Steps>
### Define audiences

OpenAPI uses `x-fern-audiences` to filter to servers, endpoints, schemas and properties.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Servers">
To mark a server with a particular audience, add the `x-fern-server-name` and `x-fern-audiences` extension to the relevant server.

In the example below, the `Production` server is only available to public consumers:

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {3-5}
servers:
  - url: https://api.com
    x-fern-server-name: Production
    x-fern-audiences:
      - public
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Endpoints">
To mark an endpoint with a particular audience, add the `x-fern-audiences` extension to the relevant endpoint.

In the example below, the `POST /users/sendEmail` endpoint is only available to public consumers:

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {4-5}
paths:
  /users/sendEmail:
    post:
      x-fern-audiences:
        - public
      operationId: send_email
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Schemas">
Schemas can be marked for different audiences, as well.

In this example, the `Email` type is available to both public and beta customers.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {13-15}
components:
  schemas:
    Email:
      title: Email
      type: object
      properties:
        subject:
          type: string
        body:
          type: string
        to:
          type: string
      x-fern-audiences:
        - public
        - beta
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Properties">
In this example, the `to` property is available to beta customers only.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {13-17}
components:
  schemas:
    Email:
      title: Email
      type: object
      properties:
        subject:
          type: string
        body:
          type: string
        to:
          type: string
          x-fern-audiences:
            - beta
```
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Set up SDK filters in `generators.yml`

In `generators.yml`, you can apply audience filters so that only certain
endpoints are passed to the generators. 

The following example configures the SDK to filter to the `public` audience:

```yaml title="generators.yml" {3-4}
groups:
  sdks:
    audiences:
      - public
    generators:
    ...
```

### Generate your SDK

  ```bash
  fern generate --group sdk
  ```
