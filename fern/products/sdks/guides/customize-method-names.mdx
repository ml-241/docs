title: Customize Method Names
description: Fine-tune SDK resources and method names
---

You can fine-tune your SDK method and group names to create intuitive, user-friendly
code that matches your API's purpose. 

For example, instead of `client.postUsers`
you can configure your SDK to read `client.users.create()`.

This page covers how to customize method and group names using Fern Definition and OpenAPI specs.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Fern Definition">

## Configure custom method names in `api.yml`

 For a Fern Definition, the method name comes from the endpoint directly.
 You can specify group and method names directly within your service structure.

In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.users.create()`:

```yaml title="api.yaml" {4, 6}
services:
  http:
    UsersService: # specify the group
      base-path: /users # HTTP path
      endpoints:
        create: # configure SDK method name
          method: POST
          path: ""
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="OpenAPI">

## Configure custom method names in `openapi.yaml`

You can customize your SDK method names in two ways:

* **Let Fern parse `operationId` (automatic):** By default, Fern uses your
  operation ID to generate method names. Format your operation IDs like
  `{tag_name}_{operation_name}` (e.g., `users_get`) and Fern will automatically
  generate `users.get()`. If your operation ID doesn't start with a tag, Fern
  uses it directly as the method name.

* **Use the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` and `x-fern-sdk-method-name` extensions
  (manual)** to explicitly define your method name and grouping.

To manually configure your method name, use the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` and
`x-fern-sdk-method-name` extensions. In the example below, Fern will generate a
method called `client.users.create()` for the `POST /users` endpoint.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {4-5}
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

## Top level methods

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method
will live at the root of the client rather than nested under a resource group.
In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.send()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml" {4}
paths:
  /send:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: send
```

## Multiple levels of nesting

<Note>
See how merge.dev uses nested groups [here](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-node-client?tab=readme-ov-file#create-link-token).
</Note>

If you add more than one `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK will nest group names.
The order of the group names is preserved in the generated SDK method.

In the example below, Fern will generate a method called `client.users.notifications.send()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users/notifications:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name:
        - users
        - notifications
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: send
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Casing is automatically configured

Fern automatically handles choosing the appropriate casing for each SDK
language: `snake_case` in python, `camelCase` in TypeScript and `PascalCase` in
  Go, etc. Because of this, you define the endpoint structure once and get
  properly formatted methods across all generated SDKs.

## Generated SDK examples

Here's how developers using your generated SDK would call the customized method names in their applications:

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    const response = await client.users.create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    response = client.users.create()
    # or async
    response = await async_client.users.create()
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
    ```java
    const response = client.users().create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Go">
    ```go
    const response = client.Users.Create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

Here's how users would call nested groups:

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```ts
    const response = await client.admin.users.create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    response = client.admin.users.create()
    # or async
    response = await async_client.admin.users.create()
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
    ```java
    const response = client.admin().users().create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Go">
    ```go
    const response = client.Admin.Users.Create();
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>
