title: Overview of the Fern Folder
description: Describes the Fern folder structure
---

Configuring Fern starts with the `fern` folder, the root directory that contains
your API definitions, generators, and your CLI version. 

After you configure your `fern` folder, you'll be ready to start generating SDKs
in different languages. 

## Directory structure

You can initialize your Fern folder with either a Fern Definition or OpenAPI specification.

<Info>
  You can always convert a Fern Definition to OpenAPI or OpenAPI to a Fern Definition later on.
</Info>

The `fern` directory is initialized with:
* A `fern.config.json` file
* A `generators.yml` file
* Either a `definition/` (for a Fern Definition spec) or `openapi/` (for an OpenAPI spec) directory that contains your API specification files.

<Accordion title="Initializing with the Fern Definition">
When you run `fern init`, your Fern folder will be initialized with the following files:
```bash
fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ definition/
    ├─ api.yml
    └─ imdb.yml
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Initializing with OpenAPI">
If you want to initialize Fern with an OpenAPI Specification, run `fern init --openapi path/to/openapi` instead.
```yaml
fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml # required on Fern version 0.41.0 and above
  └─ openapi/
    ├─ openapi.yml
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### `fern.config.json`

Every fern folder has a single `fern.config.json` file. This file stores the organization and
the version of the Fern CLI that you are using. 

```json
{
    "organization": "imdb",
    "version": "0.31.2"
}
```

Every time you run a fern CLI command, the CLI downloads itself at the correct version to ensure 
determinism. 

<Note>To upgrade the CLI, run `fern upgrade`. This will update the version field in `fern.config.json` </Note>

### `generators.yml`

The `generators.yml` file specifies which SDKs Fern should generate from your
API specification. For each generator, it specifies where the package is
published and configures customizations like package metadata, output locations,
and generation settings.

## Configuring Multiple APIs

The Fern folder can house multiple API definitions. Instead of placing your API
definitions at the top level, you can nest them within an `apis` folder. Be sure
to include a `generators.yml` file within each API folder that specifies the
location of the API definition.
