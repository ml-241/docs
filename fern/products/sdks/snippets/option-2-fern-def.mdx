1.    Initialize the Fern folder using the Fern Definition by running the following command:

      ```bash
      fern init --organization <YourOrganization>
      ```

      <Info> `--organization <YourOrganization>` configures your organization
      name in `fern.config.json`. This is required in order to successfully
      generate your SDK. </Info>

      This creates a `fern` folder in your current directory with the Fern Definition.

      ```bash
      fern/
        ├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
        ├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
        └─ definition/
          ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
          └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors
      ```

      <Note> `imdb.yml` contains an example movies API. If you’re just
      generating an SDK for test purposes, you can leave this file as it is. To
      generate an SDK for your own API instead of the example movies API,
      replace `imdb.yml` with your own endpoints, types, and errors before
      proceeding with the rest of this page. </Note>
