Fern-generated SDKs are designed to be extended with custom code. Your custom
code can add additional functionality to the SDK and live in harmony with the
generated code. 

This page explains how to configure custom logic using a
`.fernignore` file, create custom SDK methods, and add additional dependencies to your SDK.
