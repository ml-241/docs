title: What is an OpenRPC Specification?
subtitle: OpenRPC is a standard for documenting JSON-RPC APIs
---

The OpenRPC Specification is a framework used by developers to document JSON-RPC APIs. The specification 
is written in JSON or YAML and contains all of your methods, parameters, schemas, and server configurations. 
Fern is compatible with OpenRPC specification [v1.3.2](https://spec.open-rpc.org/) and [v1.2.6](https://github.com/open-rpc/spec/releases/tag/1.2.6).

Below is an example of an OpenRPC file: 

```yaml openrpc.yml 
openrpc: 1.3.2

## Setup your fern folder

Start by initializing your fern folder with an OpenRPC spec

<CodeGroup>
```sh file
fern init --openrpc ./path/to/openrpc
```
```sh url
fern init --openrpc https://host/path/to/openrpc
```
</CodeGroup>

This will initialize a directory like the following 
```
fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ openrpc/
    ├─ openrpc.yml
```
