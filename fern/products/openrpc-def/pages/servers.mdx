subtitle: Define server URLs and transport mechanisms for your JSON-RPC API
---

OpenRPC allows you to specify one or more server configurations that define how clients can connect to your JSON-RPC API.

```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: production
    url: https://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Production HTTP JSON-RPC server
  - name: websocket
    url: wss://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Production WebSocket JSON-RPC server
```

Specifying servers is valuable for both SDKs and Docs: 
- For SDKs, your users won't need to manually specify the server URL at client instantiation
- For Docs, your API playground will automatically connect to the correct server

## Transport protocols

JSON-RPC can be used over various transport protocols:

### HTTP/HTTPS Transport
```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: http-production
    url: https://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: HTTPS JSON-RPC endpoint
  - name: http-staging
    url: https://staging-api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Staging HTTPS endpoint
```

### WebSocket Transport
```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: websocket-production
    url: wss://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: WebSocket JSON-RPC for real-time communication
  - name: websocket-dev
    url: ws://localhost:8080/rpc
    description: Development WebSocket server
```

### TCP Transport
```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: tcp-production
    url: tcp://api.yourcompany.com:9090
    description: TCP JSON-RPC server for high-performance applications
```

## Server variables

Use variables to make your server configurations more flexible:

```yml openrpc.yml {3-12}
servers:
  - name: production
    url: https://{environment}.api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Production JSON-RPC server
    variables:
      environment:
        default: prod
        enum:
          - prod
          - staging
          - dev
        description: Environment name
```

## Multiple environments

Configure different environments with appropriate descriptions:

```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: production
    url: https://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Production environment - high availability, rate limited
  - name: staging
    url: https://staging-api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Staging environment - for testing new features
  - name: development
    url: http://localhost:8080/rpc
    description: Local development server
  - name: sandbox
    url: https://sandbox-api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Sandbox environment - safe for testing
```

## Server-specific configurations

Add server-specific metadata and configurations:

```yml openrpc.yml {4-12}
servers:
  - name: production
    url: https://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Production JSON-RPC server
    variables:
      version:
        default: v1
        enum: [v1, v2]
        description: API version
    summary: High-performance production server
    tags:
      - name: production
        description: Production environment
```

## Load balancing and multiple URLs

Configure multiple server URLs for load balancing:

```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: primary
    url: https://api-primary.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Primary production server
  - name: secondary
    url: https://api-secondary.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Secondary production server (fallback)
  - name: regional-us
    url: https://us.api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: US regional server
  - name: regional-eu
    url: https://eu.api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: EU regional server
```

## WebSocket-specific configurations

Configure WebSocket servers with connection parameters:

```yml openrpc.yml {4-10}
servers:
  - name: websocket-main
    url: wss://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Main WebSocket JSON-RPC server
    variables:
      protocol:
        default: "jsonrpc-2.0"
        description: JSON-RPC protocol version
      heartbeat:
        default: "30"
        description: Heartbeat interval in seconds
```

## Security configurations

Configure authentication and security at the server level:

```yml openrpc.yml {4-6}
servers:
  - name: secure-production
    url: https://api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Secure production server with authentication
    security:
      - bearerAuth: []
      - apiKeyAuth: []
components:
  securitySchemes:
    bearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
```

## Transport-specific optimizations

Configure servers for specific use cases:

```yml openrpc.yml 
servers:
  - name: bulk-operations
    url: https://bulk.api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Optimized for batch requests and bulk operations
  - name: real-time
    url: wss://realtime.api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: WebSocket server optimized for real-time notifications
  - name: analytics
    url: https://analytics.api.yourcompany.com/rpc
    description: Dedicated server for analytics and reporting methods
```

Server configurations help clients understand how to connect to your JSON-RPC API and which transport mechanism is most appropriate for their use case.
