title: Customizing slugs within your site
---

By default, Fern generates the slug of a page based on the navigation structure in the `docs.yml` file. 

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example without tabs">
```yaml docs.yml {5, 7}
instances:
  - url: plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
  
navigation:
  - section: Get Started
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```

In the example above, the **Welcome** page would be hosted at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/get-started/welcome`. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Example with tabs">
```yaml docs.yml {5, 13, 15}
instances:
  - url: plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
  
tabs: 
  docs:
    display-name: Docs
  reference: 
    display-name: API Reference
  
navigation:
  - tab: docs
    layout: 
      - section: Get Started
        contents: 
          - page: Welcome 
            path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```

In the example above, the **Welcome** page would be hosted at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/get-started/welcome`.

### Renaming slugs

#### Modify a page or section slug
To modify the slug used for a page or section, you can set the `slug` within the `navigation` object. 

```yaml {3, 6}
navigation:
  - section: Get Started
    slug: start
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        slug: intro
        path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```

In the example above, the **Welcome** page would be hosted at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/start/intro`. 

#### Modify a tab slug

To modify the slug used for a tab, you can set the `slug` within the `tabs` object. 

```yaml {4}
tabs: 
  docs:
    display-name: Docs
    slug: guides
  reference: 
    display-name: API Reference
  
navigation:
  - tab: docs
    layout: 
      - section: Get Started
        contents: 
          - page: Welcome 
            path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```

In the example above, the **Welcome** page would be hosted at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/guides/get-started/welcome`. 

#### Override a page's slug
You can set the exact slug of a page within its frontmatter. [You can read more about the frontmatter configuration here](/learn/docs/content/frontmatter#slug). 

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - section: Get Started
    slug: start
    contents: 
      - page: Quick Start 
        path: ./docs/pages/quick-start.mdx
```

You can set the slug in the frontmatter of `./docs/pages/quick-start.mdx` to `start-up`:

```markdown title="quick-start.mdx" {2}
---
slug: start-up
---
```

The page then becomes available at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/start-up`.

#### Renaming slugs for subheadings
By default, deep links to subheadings are generated by appending a `#` and the subheading title (converted to `kebab-casing-convention`) onto the page URl. 

```yaml docs.yml
navigation:
  - section: Get Started
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```

```markdown welcome.mdx
...

## Frequently Asked Questions 
...
```

The link to this section will be available at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/get-started/welcome#frequently-asked-questions`. 

To rename the slug of the subheading, add the desired slug 

```markdown welcome.mdx
## Frequently Asked Questions [#faqs]
```

The link to this section will now be available at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/get-started/welcome#faqs`.

### Skipping slugs
To ignore a tab or section when generating the slug, simply indicate `skip-slug: true`.

<Accordion title="Example without tabs">
```yaml docs.yml {6}
instances:
  - url: plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com
  
navigation:
  - section: Get Started
    skip-slug: true
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```

In the example above, the **Welcome** page would be hosted at `plantstore.docs.buildwithfern.com/welcome`. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Example with tabs">
```yaml docs.yml {7, 15}

        contents: 
          - page: Welcome 
            path: ./docs/pages/welcome.mdx
```
