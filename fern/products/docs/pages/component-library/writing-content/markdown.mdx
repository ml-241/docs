Learn how to use Markdown syntax to create rich, formatted content for your documentation.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to add formatting to plain text documents. It's widely used for documentation because of its simplicity and readability.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some common Markdown elements:

- **Bold text**: `**bold**`
- *Italic text*: `*italic*`
- [Links](https://example.com): `[Links](https://example.com)`
- Lists: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points
- Code: Use backticks for `inline code`

## Advanced Features

You can also use more advanced Markdown features like tables, code blocks, and more.
