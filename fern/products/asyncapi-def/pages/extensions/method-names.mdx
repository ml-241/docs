title: SDK Method Names
subtitle: Use `x-fern-sdk-method-name` to customize SDK method names for operations
---

By default, Fern generates SDK method names based on your operation names in AsyncAPI. You can override this behavior using the `x-fern-sdk-method-name` extension.

## Customize operation method names

Use `x-fern-sdk-method-name` to specify custom method names for your operations:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-7, 13-14}
operations:
  subscribeToUserEvents:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/user~1events'
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: onUserEvent
    summary: Subscribe to user events
  publishOrderUpdate:
    action: send
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/order~1updates'
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: sendOrderUpdate
    summary: Publish order update
```

This will generate SDK methods like:

```typescript
// Instead of client.subscribeToUserEvents()
client.onUserEvent((event) => {
  // Handle user event
});

// Instead of client.publishOrderUpdate()
client.sendOrderUpdate(orderData);
```

## Method naming conventions

Follow these conventions when naming SDK methods:

### Subscribe operations
Use descriptive names that indicate the action:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {4-5}
operations:
  subscribeToNotifications:
    action: receive
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: onNotification
    # Generates: client.onNotification()
    
  subscribeToOrderUpdates:
    action: receive
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: watchOrders
    # Generates: client.watchOrders()
```

### Publish operations
Use action-oriented names:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {4-5}
operations:
  publishUserSignup:
    action: send
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: createUser
    # Generates: client.createUser()
    
  publishNotification:
    action: send
    x-fern-sdk-method-name: notify
    # Generates: client.notify()
```

## Language-specific method names

You can specify different method names for different programming languages:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-11}
operations:
  subscribeToEvents:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/events'
    x-fern-sdk-method-name:
      python: on_event
      typescript: onEvent
      go: OnEvent
      java: onEvent
      csharp: OnEvent
```

This ensures method names follow the conventions of each target language.
