subtitle: Additional Fern extensions for AsyncAPI specifications
---

Fern supports various extensions to enhance your AsyncAPI specifications and improve the generated SDKs and documentation.

## `x-fern-ignore`

Use `x-fern-ignore` to exclude specific operations, channels, or schemas from SDK generation:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-7, 13-14}
operations:
  debugOperation:
    action: send
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/debug'
    x-fern-ignore: true
    summary: Debug operation (internal only)

channels:
  internal/debug:
    address: internal/debug
    x-fern-ignore: true
    messages:
      DebugMessage:
        $ref: '#/components/messages/DebugMessage'
```

## `x-fern-examples`

Provide additional examples for better SDK documentation:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {8-20}
components:
  messages:
    UserEvent:
      contentType: application/json
      payload:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
      x-fern-examples:
        - name: NewUserSignup
          summary: Example of a new user signup event
          payload:
            id: "user_123"
            email: "john@example.com"
            name: "John Doe"
            status: "active"
        - name: UserDeactivation
          summary: Example of user deactivation event
          payload:
            id: "user_456"
            email: "jane@example.com"
            name: "Jane Smith"
            status: "inactive"
```

## `x-fern-pagination`

Configure pagination for operations that return multiple results:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-11}
operations:
  listUserEvents:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/user~1events'
    x-fern-pagination:
      cursor: next_cursor
      results: events
      next_cursor: pagination.next_cursor
      has_next_page: pagination.has_next_page
```

## `x-fern-retry`

Configure retry behavior for operations:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-10}
operations:
  sendCriticalAlert:
    action: send
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/alerts'
    x-fern-retry:
      max_attempts: 3
      exponential_backoff: true
      initial_delay: 1000
      max_delay: 30000
```

## `x-fern-streaming`

Mark operations as streaming for appropriate SDK generation:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-9}
operations:
  streamEvents:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/event~1stream'
    x-fern-streaming:
      type: server_sent_events
      termination: client_closes
```

## `x-fern-error-handling`

Configure error handling for operations:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-16}
operations:
  sendMessage:
    action: send
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/messages'
    x-fern-error-handling:
      error_schema:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/MessageError'
      error_status_codes:
        - 400
        - 429
        - 500
      retry_on_errors:
        - 429
        - 500
```

## `x-fern-server-name`

Specify custom names for servers:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {4-5}
servers:
  production:
    host: api.yourcompany.com
    x-fern-server-name: Production
    protocol: wss
  staging:
    host: staging.api.yourcompany.com
    x-fern-server-name: Staging
    protocol: wss
```

## `x-fern-availability`

Mark features as available in specific SDK versions:

```yaml title="asyncapi.yml" {6-8}
operations:
  newFeature:
    action: send
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/new~1feature'
    x-fern-availability:
      status: beta
      message: "This feature is in beta and may change"
```

These extensions help you create more robust and user-friendly SDKs while maintaining full control over the generated code structure and behavior.
