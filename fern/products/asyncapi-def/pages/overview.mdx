title: What is an AsyncAPI Specification?
subtitle: AsyncAPI is a standard for documenting event-driven APIs
---

The AsyncAPI Specification is a framework used by developers to document event-driven APIs. The specification 
is written in JSON or YAML and contains all of your channels, messages, schemas, and authentication schemes. 
Fern is compatible with AsyncAPI specification [v2.6.0](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0) and [v3.0.0](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0).

Below is an example of an AsyncAPI file: 

```yaml asyncapi.yml

## Setup your fern folder

Start by initializing your fern folder with an AsyncAPI spec

<CodeGroup>
```sh file
fern init --asyncapi ./path/to/asyncapi
```
```sh url
fern init --asyncapi https://host/path/to/asyncapi
```
</CodeGroup>

This will initialize a directory like the following 
```
fern/
  ├─ fern.config.json
  ├─ generators.yml
  └─ asyncapi/
    ├─ asyncapi.yml
```
